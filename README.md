# chartjs-react-dashboard

Using the .NET Web API backend and React frontend structures, the data fetched through the chartjs library was transferred to the dashboard.

Tooltip is added to each chart and detail information is shown with mouse hoover movement. In the table at the end, current developments can be displayed and approval or rejection can be made.
